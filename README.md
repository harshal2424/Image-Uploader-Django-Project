### Installation

1.  **Clone the GitHub repository:**

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    * It's best practice to use a virtual environment. You mentioned using `myenv`, so let's stick with that.

    ```bash
    # Create the virtual environment
    python -m venv myenv

    # Activate it (on Windows)
    .\myenv\Scripts\activate

    # Activate it (on macOS/Linux)
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install Django Pillow
    ```

4.  **Set up the database:**
    * This will create the necessary tables in your SQLite database based on the `models.py` file.
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

6.  **View the application!**
